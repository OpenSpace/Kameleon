This directory is used to manage building documentation for the Kameleon project.

Requirements:
	sphinx: http://sphinx-doc.org/index.html
	doxygen: http://doxygen.org/
	breathe: https://breathe.readthedocs.org/en/latest/quickstart.html

I created the configuration file conf.py by running sphinx-quickstart. This also generated 
the Makefile which we invoke below.
To generate documentation, run:
	make html
To generate the manual, run:
	make latex


For now, the above commands have to be rerun whenever the documentation changes.
Sphinx will invoke breathe, which reads the xml documentation created by Doxygen in ../doc/

Eventually, this will all be automated through cmake...
