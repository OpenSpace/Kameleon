Included in this directory are CDF files containing the ionospheric component 
of SWMF for the 2006 December event and the example fortran test code to 
access and interpolate the data. The CDF files each contain one timestep.

The example fortran code can be compiled by extracting fortran_test.tar.gz and 
modifying the Makefile to select the appropriate configure options for your 
operating system. The compilation has been tested on Linux and OSX.

1. Edit Makefile  
   CDF_OPTIONS and KAMELEON_PLUS_CONFIGURE must be defined to the correct 
   variables for the operating system  
   F77, CC, and CXX must point to the system fortran, c, and c++ compilers
   NJOBS should be set to the number of cores on the system. If this is left 
   blank, an infinite number of parallel jobs are used during compilation.
2. make all

If your compiler does not support the -Ofast option, replace it with -O3 -ffast
-math or -O3 or your preferred compiler optimizations (replace all instances)

The example fortran program, fortran_test, opens a CDF file and interpolates 
the selected variable (such as 'ep' [electric potential]) onto a 181x181 grid 
to standard output. The default missing value is -1.09951163E+12

NOTE: the SWMF ionospheric electrodynamics files do not have values at the poles.

main.f and kameleon_f.f show how to use the time interpolator using a 
directory of timestep files. 
In this example, the directory path and prefix of all files is hardcoded in 
kameleon_f.f, so this
must be updated to reflect the actual location of the CDF files.

 file_path='/path/to/your/test_files_directory'

You must also choose an interpolation time to be within the range of time 
steps to be loaded; set the following variables in main.f:

         itime(1)= 2001      ! year
         itime(2)= 08        ! month
         itime(3)= 29        ! day
         itime(4)= 04         ! hour
         itime(5)= 0        ! min
         itime(6)= 0        ! sec
